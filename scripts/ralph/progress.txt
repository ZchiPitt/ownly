# Ralph Progress Log
# Project: Clekee - Smart Home Inventory App
# Branch: ralph/smart-home-inventory-mvp
# Created: 2026-01-23

## Codebase Patterns
- Uses Tailwind CSS v4 with @tailwindcss/vite plugin (no tailwind.config.js needed)
- Uses TanStack React Query for server state management
- Uses React Router v6 for navigation
- Mobile-first design approach
- Supabase client in `/src/lib/supabase.ts` - import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase'
- Use `import.meta.env.VITE_*` for environment variables (Vite pattern)
- SQL migrations in `supabase/migrations/` with timestamp prefix (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql)
- The `update_updated_at_column()` function exists and is reusable for other tables needing updated_at triggers
- Trigger chain for new users: auth.users -> profiles (via handle_new_user) -> user_settings (via handle_new_profile)
- The `update_location_item_count()` function maintains location.item_count on items table changes (handles insert, delete, soft-delete, restore, location changes)
- pgvector extension enabled for vector similarity search with HNSW indexing
- Use `search_similar_items()` function for client-side similarity search (uses auth.uid() for RLS)
- Types exported from `/src/types/index.ts` - import { Item, Profile, etc. } from '@/types'
- Database type from `/src/types/database.ts` - use with createClient<Database>()
- API request/response types from `/src/types/api.ts` for Edge Functions and client-side data fetching
- Storage bucket 'items' for photos: upload to items/{user_id}/{filename}, RLS enforces user-only access
- Path alias `@/` configured in vite.config.ts and tsconfig.app.json - use `import { x } from '@/lib/...'`
- AuthProvider context at `/src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx` - wrap app with `<AuthProvider>`
- useAuth hook at `/src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - use `const { user, session, signIn, signOut } = useAuth()`
- For Fast Refresh compatibility: separate createContext() into its own .ts file, keep provider in .tsx
- ProtectedRoute wrapper at `/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - wrap protected routes with `<ProtectedRoute>`
- Context exports from `/src/contexts/index.ts` - import { AuthProvider, AuthContext } from '@/contexts'
- AppShell layout at `/src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx` - use `<AppShell>` for pages with bottom nav
- BottomNav at `/src/components/layout/BottomNav.tsx` - 4 tabs (Home, Add FAB, Inventory, Settings)
- Layout exports from `/src/components/layout/index.ts` - import { AppShell, BottomNav } from '@/components/layout'
- Pages exported from `/src/pages/index.ts` - import { SignupPage, LoginPage, etc. } from '@/pages'
- Auth pages (/signup, /login, /reset-password) are outside AppShell - no bottom navigation
- Simple Toast component at `/src/components/Toast.tsx` - use `<Toast message="" type="error" onClose={() => {}} />` (to be expanded in US-083)

  - The project uses React 19 with concurrent features
  - TanStack React Query v5 is installed
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-002
- What was implemented:
  - Installed @supabase/supabase-js package
  - Created /src/lib/supabase.ts with typed client initialization
  - Created placeholder Database type in /src/types/database.ts (to be expanded in US-011)
  - Created .env.example with VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY placeholders
  - Added .env to .gitignore for security

- Files changed:
  - package.json, package-lock.json (added supabase dependency)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Supabase client accepts a generic Database type for full TypeScript support
  - Use `import.meta.env.VITE_*` for Vite environment variables
  - Always validate env vars exist at runtime with meaningful error messages
  - The Database type will be expanded in US-011 with full schema
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-003
- What was implemented:
  - Created SQL migration file for profiles table at `supabase/migrations/20260123000001_create_profiles_table.sql`
  - Fields: id (uuid PK), user_id (uuid FK to auth.users, unique), display_name (varchar 50), avatar_url (text nullable), created_at, updated_at
  - Enabled RLS on profiles table
  - Added RLS policies: users can only read/update/insert their own profile
  - Added trigger `on_auth_user_created` to create profile on auth.users insert
  - Added `update_updated_at_column` function and trigger for automatic updated_at maintenance
  - Added documentation comments on table and columns

- Files changed:
  - supabase/migrations/20260123000001_create_profiles_table.sql (new)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Supabase migrations go in `supabase/migrations/` folder with timestamp prefix
  - Use `SECURITY DEFINER` on trigger functions that need to access auth.users
  - Extract display_name from email with `split_part(email, '@', 1)` as fallback
  - Include INSERT policy for RLS when using triggers that insert data
  - The `update_updated_at_column()` function is reusable for other tables
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-004
- What was implemented:
  - Created SQL migration file for user_settings table at `supabase/migrations/20260123000002_create_user_settings_table.sql`
  - Fields: id (uuid PK), user_id (uuid FK unique), reminder_enabled (bool default true), reminder_threshold_days (int default 90), expiration_reminder_days (int default 7), push_notifications_enabled (bool default false), default_view (varchar 20 default 'gallery'), created_at, updated_at
  - Enabled RLS on user_settings table
  - Added RLS policies: users can only read/update/insert their own settings
  - Added trigger `on_profile_created` to create user_settings when profile is inserted
  - Reused `update_updated_at_column` function from profiles migration for updated_at trigger
  - Added documentation comments on table and columns

- Files changed:
  - supabase/migrations/20260123000002_create_user_settings_table.sql (new)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The user_settings trigger listens to profiles table insert, not auth.users directly - this ensures proper chain: auth.users -> profiles -> user_settings
  - Reference user_id from NEW.user_id when trigger is on profiles table (not NEW.id)
  - The `update_updated_at_column()` function created in US-003 is shared across all tables
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-005
- What was implemented:
  - Created SQL migration file for categories table at `supabase/migrations/20260123000003_create_categories_table.sql`
  - Fields: id (uuid PK), user_id (uuid FK nullable), name (varchar 50), icon (varchar 10 default box emoji), color (varchar 7 default gray), is_system (bool default false), sort_order (int default 0), created_at
  - Enabled RLS on categories table
  - Added RLS policies: system categories readable by all authenticated users, user categories only by owner
  - Added separate policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on user categories
  - Inserted 10 system preset categories: Clothing, Food & Beverage, Electronics, Kitchen, Sports & Fitness, Tools, Books & Documents, Personal Care, Home Decor, Other
  - Each system category has unique icon, color, and sort_order

- Files changed:
  - supabase/migrations/20260123000003_create_categories_table.sql (new)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - System categories have user_id = NULL and is_system = true
  - User categories have user_id set and is_system = false
  - RLS policies need to check is_system flag to prevent users from modifying system categories
  - Categories table doesn't need updated_at since category changes are rare
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-006
- What was implemented:
  - Created SQL migration file for locations table at `supabase/migrations/20260123000004_create_locations_table.sql`
  - Fields: id (uuid PK), user_id (uuid FK), name (varchar 100), parent_id (uuid FK self-ref nullable), path (text), depth (int default 1), icon (varchar 10 default pin emoji), photo_url (text nullable), item_count (int default 0), created_at, updated_at, deleted_at (nullable)
  - Enabled RLS on locations table with user-only access policies
  - Added separate policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
  - SELECT policy filters out soft-deleted locations (deleted_at IS NULL)
  - Added indexes on user_id, parent_id, and deleted_at columns
  - Reused `update_updated_at_column` function from profiles migration for updated_at trigger
  - Created `update_location_path` function and trigger to auto-maintain path and depth fields
  - Added comprehensive documentation comments on table and columns

- Files changed:
  - supabase/migrations/20260123000004_create_locations_table.sql (new)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Locations table uses self-referential FK (parent_id references locations.id) for hierarchy
  - ON DELETE SET NULL for parent_id allows graceful handling when parent location is deleted
  - The path field is auto-maintained by trigger using format "Parent > Child > Grandchild"
  - The depth field is auto-calculated (1 for root, increments per level)
  - item_count will be maintained by triggers on the items table (US-009)
  - Soft delete pattern: deleted_at is nullable, SELECT policy filters out non-null deleted_at
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-007
- What was implemented:
  - Created SQL migration file for items table at `supabase/migrations/20260123000005_create_items_table.sql`
  - Fields: id (uuid PK), user_id (uuid FK), photo_url (text NOT NULL), thumbnail_url (text nullable), name (varchar 200 nullable), description (text nullable), category_id (uuid FK nullable), tags (text[] default {}), location_id (uuid FK nullable), quantity (int default 1 with check 1-999), price (decimal 10,2 nullable), currency (varchar 3 default CNY), purchase_date (date nullable), expiration_date (date nullable), brand (varchar 100 nullable), model (varchar 100 nullable), notes (text nullable), is_favorite (bool default false), keep_forever (bool default false), ai_metadata (jsonb nullable), last_viewed_at (timestamptz nullable), created_at, updated_at, deleted_at (nullable)
  - Enabled RLS on items table with user-only access policies
  - Added separate policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
  - SELECT policy filters out soft-deleted items (deleted_at IS NULL)
  - Added indexes on user_id, category_id, location_id, deleted_at columns
  - Reused `update_updated_at_column` function from profiles migration for updated_at trigger
  - Added comprehensive documentation comments on table and columns

- Files changed:
  - supabase/migrations/20260123000005_create_items_table.sql (new)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Items table uses ON DELETE SET NULL for category_id and location_id to allow graceful handling when category/location is deleted
  - The tags field uses PostgreSQL array type (text[]) with default empty array '{}'
  - Added CHECK constraint on quantity (1-999) for data validation
  - The ai_metadata field is JSONB for storing AI analysis results flexibly
  - keep_forever=true excludes items from unused item reminders
  - The location.item_count field will be maintained by triggers in US-009
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-008
- What was implemented:
  - Created SQL migration file for notifications table at `supabase/migrations/20260123000006_create_notifications_table.sql`
  - Fields: id (uuid PK), user_id (uuid FK), type (varchar 30 with CHECK constraint: unused_item, expiring_item, system), title (varchar 200 NOT NULL), body (text), item_id (uuid FK nullable), is_read (bool default false), is_pushed (bool default false), pushed_at (timestamptz nullable), created_at
  - Enabled RLS on notifications table with user-only access policies
  - Added separate policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
  - Added indexes on user_id, is_read, and composite (user_id, is_read) for query performance
  - Used ON DELETE CASCADE for item_id FK (notifications deleted when item is deleted)
  - Added comprehensive documentation comments on table and columns

- Files changed:
  - supabase/migrations/20260123000006_create_notifications_table.sql (new)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Notifications table uses CHECK constraint for type enum rather than PostgreSQL ENUM type (simpler migrations)
  - ON DELETE CASCADE for item_id ensures notifications are cleaned up when items are deleted
  - Composite index on (user_id, is_read) optimizes common query pattern for unread notification counts
  - No updated_at column needed since notifications are typically write-once (only is_read changes)
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-009
- What was implemented:
  - Created SQL migration file for location item_count trigger at `supabase/migrations/20260123000007_create_location_item_count_trigger.sql`
  - Created `update_location_item_count()` function to handle all item count changes
  - Handles INSERT: increment new location's count if location_id is set and item is not soft-deleted
  - Handles DELETE (hard delete): decrement location's count if location_id was set
  - Handles UPDATE with soft-delete: decrement count when deleted_at changes from NULL to a value
  - Handles UPDATE with restore: increment count when deleted_at changes from a value to NULL
  - Handles UPDATE location_id change: decrement old location, increment new location
  - All operations use GREATEST(item_count - 1, 0) to prevent negative counts
  - Trigger fires AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE for each row

- Files changed:
  - supabase/migrations/20260123000007_create_location_item_count_trigger.sql (new)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use AFTER trigger (not BEFORE) when updating related tables since it fires after the main operation completes
  - Use `IS DISTINCT FROM` for null-safe comparison of location_id changes
  - Use GREATEST(item_count - 1, 0) to prevent negative item counts (defensive programming)
  - Need to check both location_id and deleted_at status when calculating whether to update counts
  - The trigger handles restore from soft-delete (deleted_at NULL -> value -> NULL cycle)
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-010
- What was implemented:
  - Created SQL migration file at `supabase/migrations/20260123000008_add_pgvector_embedding.sql`
  - Enabled pgvector extension with `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector`
  - Added embedding column to items table: vector(1536) nullable for OpenAI text-embedding-3-small compatibility
  - Created HNSW index on embedding column using vector_cosine_ops for cosine similarity
  - Created `search_items_by_embedding()` function (SECURITY DEFINER) for server-side similarity search with explicit user_id parameter
  - Created `search_similar_items()` function (SECURITY INVOKER) for client-side use that respects RLS via auth.uid()
  - Both functions support configurable match_threshold and match_count parameters

- Files changed:
  - supabase/migrations/20260123000008_add_pgvector_embedding.sql (new)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - pgvector extension is pre-installed in Supabase but needs to be explicitly enabled
  - HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) index is preferred over IVFFlat for better query performance without training
  - Use `<=>` operator for cosine distance in pgvector (returns distance, so similarity = 1 - distance)
  - SECURITY DEFINER functions bypass RLS - use explicit user_id parameter for server-side calls
  - SECURITY INVOKER functions respect RLS - use auth.uid() for client-side calls
  - HNSW parameters: m=16 (connections per layer), ef_construction=64 (construction quality) are good defaults
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-011
- What was implemented:
  - Updated /src/types/database.ts with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces matching database schema:
    - Profile: User profile extending auth.users
    - UserSettings: User personalization preferences with default_view union type
    - Category: Category with nullable user_id for system vs user categories
    - Location: Storage location with hierarchical support (parent_id, path, depth)
    - Item: Core inventory item with tags array, ai_metadata JSONB, and pgvector embedding
    - Notification: User notification with NotificationType union type
    - ItemAIMetadata: Flexible JSON interface for AI analysis results
  - Created Supabase Database type definition with Row, Insert, Update types for each table
  - Added Functions type definitions for search_similar_items and search_items_by_embedding
  - Added utility types: TableRow, TableInsert, TableUpdate for type extraction
  - Created /src/types/api.ts with comprehensive request/response types:
    - Generic API types (ApiResponse, ApiError, PaginatedResponse)
    - Auth request/response types
    - CRUD types for all entities (Create, Update, Response types)
    - AI analysis types (DetectedItem, AnalyzeImageResponse, ShoppingAnalyzeResponse)
    - Dashboard and search types
  - Created /src/types/index.ts as central export point for all types

- Files changed:
  - src/types/database.ts (updated with full schema types)
  - src/types/api.ts (new)
  - src/types/index.ts (new)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use union types for constrained string fields like `default_view: 'gallery' | 'list'`
  - pgvector embedding is typed as `number[] | null` since TypeScript doesn't have a native vector type
  - ItemAIMetadata uses index signature `[key: string]: unknown` for flexible AI response storage
  - Supabase Database type uses Row/Insert/Update pattern for table type definitions
  - Insert types make auto-generated fields optional (id, created_at, etc.)
  - Update types use Partial and exclude fields that shouldn't be updated (id, user_id, etc.)
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-012
- What was implemented:
  - Created SQL migration file at `supabase/migrations/20260123000009_create_items_storage_bucket.sql`
  - Created 'items' storage bucket with INSERT INTO storage.buckets
  - Configured file_size_limit to 10MB (10485760 bytes)
  - Configured allowed_mime_types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp, image/heic
  - Created RLS policies for storage.objects table:
    - INSERT policy: Users can upload to items/{user_id}/* folder only
    - SELECT policy: Users can read/download their own files only
    - UPDATE policy: Users can update their own files only
    - DELETE policy: Users can delete their own files only
  - Used storage.foldername(name)[1] to extract user_id from file path for RLS checks

- Files changed:
  - supabase/migrations/20260123000009_create_items_storage_bucket.sql (new)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Supabase storage buckets are managed via storage.buckets table (INSERT/UPDATE)
  - Use ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE to make migration idempotent for bucket settings
  - RLS policies on storage.objects control file access, using storage.foldername() helper
  - storage.foldername(name) returns array of folder path segments, [1] gets first folder (user_id)
  - File path structure: bucket/{user_id}/{filename} - user_id is extracted for RLS
  - bucket_id field in storage.objects identifies which bucket the file belongs to
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-013
- What was implemented:
  - Created /src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx with AuthProvider component
  - Created /src/contexts/authContext.ts with AuthContext (separated for Fast Refresh compatibility)
  - Created /src/hooks/useAuth.ts hook to consume AuthContext
  - Created /src/types/auth.ts with AuthContextValue interface
  - AuthProvider provides: user, session, loading, signUp, signIn, signOut, resetPassword, updatePassword
  - Listens to supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange for session updates
  - Handles token expiry (SIGNED_OUT event) and token refresh (TOKEN_REFRESHED event)
  - Configured path aliases (`@/`) in vite.config.ts and tsconfig.app.json

- Files changed:

  - src/lib/supabase.ts (updated to use @/ path alias)
  - vite.config.ts (added path alias configuration)
  - tsconfig.app.json (added path alias configuration)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - React Fast Refresh plugin requires component-only exports in .tsx files
  - Separate context instance (createContext) from provider component for ESLint compliance
  - Use @/ path alias for cleaner imports (configured in both vite.config.ts and tsconfig.app.json)
  - supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange provides events: SIGNED_IN, SIGNED_OUT, TOKEN_REFRESHED, etc.
  - Always use useCallback for context methods to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - useMemo for context value prevents child re-renders when state hasn't changed
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-014
- What was implemented:
  - Created /src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx wrapper component
  - Check authentication status from AuthContext via useAuth hook
  - Redirects unauthenticated users to /login with redirect param preserving original path
  - Shows animated loading spinner while checking auth status
  - Renders children when user is authenticated
  - Uses encodeURIComponent for safe redirect URL encoding

- Files changed:
  - src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx (new)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `useLocation()` from react-router-dom to get current pathname and search params
  - Preserve original path with `encodeURIComponent(location.pathname + location.search)` for post-login redirect
  - Use `<Navigate to={...} replace />` to redirect without adding to browser history
  - The loading state from useAuth is true until initial session check completes
  - Use `<>{children}</>` to render children without extra wrapper element
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-015
- What was implemented:
  - Created /src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx with header area and bottom nav integration
  - Created /src/components/layout/BottomNav.tsx with 4 tabs: Home, Add (center FAB), Inventory, Settings
  - Bottom nav is fixed at bottom, 56px height (h-14), white background with top border
  - Active tab highlighted with blue-600 primary color, icon filled and text bold
  - Center Add button is larger/prominent FAB style with blue-600 background
  - Tabs navigate to: /dashboard, /add, /inventory, /settings
  - Created layout index.ts for clean exports
  - Updated App.tsx to use AppShell and added placeholder pages for each route
  - Renamed context files to avoid macOS case-sensitivity issues (AuthContext.tsx -> AuthProvider.tsx, authContext.ts -> auth-context.ts)
  - Created /src/contexts/index.ts for clean context exports

- Files changed:
  - src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx (new)
  - src/components/layout/BottomNav.tsx (new)
  - src/components/layout/index.ts (new)
  - src/contexts/AuthProvider.tsx (renamed from AuthContext.tsx)
  - src/contexts/auth-context.ts (renamed from authContext.ts)
  - src/contexts/index.ts (new)
  - src/App.tsx (updated - added AppShell, placeholder pages, routes)
  - src/hooks/useAuth.ts (updated import path)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - On macOS (case-insensitive file system), avoid files with same name different case (e.g., authContext.ts vs AuthContext.tsx)
  - Use dash-separated naming for consistency (auth-context.ts) when splitting context and provider
  - Create index.ts files for directories to provide clean exports
  - BottomNav uses NavLink from react-router-dom with active state detection via useLocation
  - FAB style center button uses negative margin (-mt-5) to extend above the nav bar
  - AppShell adds pb-14 (padding-bottom 56px) to content to account for fixed bottom nav
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-016
- What was implemented:
  - Created /src/pages/SignupPage.tsx at route /signup with full registration form
  - Email input with real-time validation (email format check using regex)
  - Password input with validation (minimum 8 characters)
  - Confirm password input with validation (must match password)
  - Inline validation errors shown below each field on blur
  - Create Account button disabled until all validations pass
  - Footer link: "Already have an account? Log in" -> /login
  - Created /src/pages/index.ts barrel export for pages
  - Updated App.tsx to add /signup route outside AppShell (no bottom nav for auth pages)

- Files changed:
  - src/pages/SignupPage.tsx (new)
  - src/pages/index.ts (new)
  - src/App.tsx (updated - restructured routes to separate auth from protected routes)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Auth pages (/signup, /login, etc.) should be outside AppShell since they don't need bottom navigation
  - Use nested Routes for grouping protected routes inside AppShell wrapper
  - Form validation pattern: use `touched` state to track which fields have been visited, only show errors for touched fields
  - Use `useMemo` for computing validation errors to avoid recalculating on every render
  - Email validation regex: `/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/` covers most common cases
  - Button disabled state: combine isFormValid check with Tailwind conditional classes
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-017
- What was implemented:
  - Connected SignupPage form to AuthContext signUp function using useAuth hook
  - Added isSubmitting state to track form submission in progress
  - Button shows loading spinner (SVG animated) during submission with "Creating Account..." text
  - Form inputs are disabled during submission to prevent double-submit
  - On success: auto-login via Supabase, navigate to /dashboard with replace
  - On email exists error: show inline error "This email is already registered" with "Log in" link
  - On network error: show toast notification "Network connection failed"
  - On other errors: show toast notification "Registration failed. Please try again later"
  - Created /src/components/Toast.tsx - simple toast notification component (to be expanded in US-083)

- Files changed:
  - src/pages/SignupPage.tsx (updated - added form submission, loading state, error handling)
  - src/components/Toast.tsx (new - simple toast component)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Supabase error messages can be checked with .includes() for specific error types (e.g., 'user already registered')
  - Use try/catch to handle unexpected errors like network failures
  - Form inputs should be disabled during submission to prevent double-submit
  - Toast component positioned at bottom-20 to account for BottomNav (h-14 = 56px)
  - Loading spinner uses Tailwind animate-spin class with SVG circle and path

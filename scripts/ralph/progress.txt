## 2026-01-23 - US-001
- What was implemented:
  - Created React app with Vite and TypeScript template
  - Installed and configured Tailwind CSS v4 with @tailwindcss/vite plugin
  - Installed React Router v6 for navigation
  - Installed TanStack React Query for server state management
  - Created base folder structure: /src/components, /src/pages, /src/hooks, /src/lib, /src/types
  - Configured App.tsx with QueryClientProvider and BrowserRouter

- Files changed:
  - package.json (dependencies and project metadata)
  - vite.config.ts (added Tailwind plugin)
  - src/index.css (Tailwind imports and base styles)
  - src/App.tsx (React Query and Router setup)
  - Created folder structure with .gitkeep files

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tailwind CSS v4 uses `@import "tailwindcss"` syntax, no @tailwind directives
  - Tailwind CSS v4 doesn't need tailwind.config.js when using @tailwindcss/vite plugin
  - The project uses React 19 with concurrent features
  - TanStack React Query v5 is installed

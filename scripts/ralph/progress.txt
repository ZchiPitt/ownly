## Codebase Patterns
- Edge Functions use `Deno.serve()` for HTTP handling and `corsHeaders` from `../_shared/cors.ts`
- Edge Functions use service role key for bypassing RLS when needed
- Use `jsr:@supabase/supabase-js@2` for Supabase client in Edge Functions
- Notifications table has `is_pushed` and `pushed_at` columns for tracking push delivery
- Push subscriptions store `endpoint`, `p256dh`, `auth` keys from Web Push API
- Database triggers use `pg_net` extension for async HTTP calls to Edge Functions
- Trigger configuration requires `app.settings.supabase_url` and `app.settings.service_role_key` via Supabase Vault
- User presence table tracks active_listing_id with last_seen timestamp for push suppression
- Hooks for database upserts should use type casting with `ReturnType<typeof supabase.from>` to handle typing issues
- Custom service worker code: use vite-plugin-pwa `workbox.importScripts` with files in `public/` directory
- Message batching uses pending_push_notifications table with 5-second window - process via scheduled job calling process-batched-notifications Edge Function
- Items table columns: Update migration, database.ts (Item interface + Insert type), and ItemDetailPage.tsx RawItemDetails interface

## 2026-02-03 - US-001
- **What was implemented**: Created `send-push-notification` Edge Function
- **Files changed**:
  - `supabase/functions/send-push-notification/index.ts` (new)
  - `CLAUDE.md` (updated Edge Functions table and VAPID documentation)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Web Push requires VAPID authentication with JWT tokens signed using ES256 (ECDSA P-256)
  - Deno's native `crypto.subtle` API can handle ECDH key agreement and AES-GCM encryption
  - Push subscriptions that return 404 or 410 should be removed (expired/unsubscribed)
  - VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY, VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY, and VAPID_SUBJECT must be set as Supabase secrets
  - The `aes128gcm` content encoding format requires specific header structure: salt (16 bytes) + record size (4 bytes) + keyid length (1 byte) + server public key (65 bytes) + encrypted data

## 2026-02-03 - US-002
- **What was implemented**: Created database trigger for notification push delivery
- **Files changed**:
  - `supabase/migrations/20260203000001_create_push_notification_trigger.sql` (new)
  - `supabase/functions/send-push-notification/index.ts` (updated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `pg_net` extension enables async HTTP calls from database triggers without blocking
  - Trigger WHEN clause allows conditional execution (e.g., `WHEN (NEW.is_pushed = false)`)
  - Database settings for Edge Function URLs can be stored in Supabase Vault and accessed via `current_setting()`
  - AFTER INSERT triggers ensure the row exists when the Edge Function queries it
  - Edge Function should update `is_pushed = true` and `pushed_at = now()` after successful delivery to prevent duplicate pushes

## 2026-02-03 - US-003
- **What was implemented**: Added user presence tracking for smart push suppression
- **Files changed**:
  - `supabase/migrations/20260203000002_create_user_presence_table.sql` (new)
  - `supabase/migrations/20260203000003_add_presence_check_to_push_trigger.sql` (new)
  - `src/hooks/usePresence.ts` (new)
  - `src/pages/ChatPage.tsx` (updated - added presence tracking)
  - `src/types/database.ts` (updated - added UserPresence type)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Presence tracking uses a unique index on user_id to ensure one presence record per user
  - The usePresence hook uses setInterval (20s) to keep presence fresh while on a conversation
  - Trigger function extracts `listing_id` from notification `data` JSONB field for presence check
  - When skipping push due to presence, still mark `is_pushed = true` to prevent re-triggering
  - Type casting `supabase.from()` with `ReturnType<typeof supabase.from>` helps with upsert type issues

## 2026-02-03 - US-004
- **What was implemented**: Real-time chat push notifications with proper formatting and service worker click handling
- **Files changed**:
  - `src/lib/notifications.ts` (updated - new_message format and message_preview field)
  - `src/hooks/useMessages.ts` (updated - pass message preview to notification)
  - `public/sw-push.js` (new - custom service worker for push/click handling)
  - `vite.config.ts` (updated - importScripts for custom SW)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - vite-plugin-pwa supports `importScripts` in workbox config to inject custom service worker code
  - Custom SW file goes in `public/` directory and is served at root (e.g., `/sw-push.js`)
  - Service worker `notificationclick` handler should use `clients.matchAll()` to find existing windows before opening new ones
  - Notification `data` object persists custom fields (type, listing_id) through to the click handler
  - Message preview should be truncated to 50 chars for push body to maintain readability
---

## 2026-02-03 - US-005
- **What was implemented**: Message batching for rapid messages from same sender
- **Files changed**:
  - `supabase/migrations/20260203000004_create_pending_push_notifications_table.sql` (new)
  - `supabase/migrations/20260203000005_add_message_batching_to_push_trigger.sql` (new)
  - `supabase/functions/process-batched-notifications/index.ts` (new)
  - `src/hooks/usePresence.ts` (updated - added clearPendingBatch function)
  - `src/types/database.ts` (updated - added PendingPushNotification type)
  - `CLAUDE.md` (updated - documented new Edge Function)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use UNIQUE constraint on (user_id, sender_id, listing_id) for pending batches instead of separate index
  - ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE allows atomic upsert for batch accumulation
  - The process-batched-notifications function should be called via scheduled job (every 5 seconds) - Supabase doesn't have built-in cron, use external scheduler
  - Batches older than 1 hour should be deleted to prevent buildup from failed processing
  - Clear pending batches when user views conversation via setActiveConversation hook
---

## 2026-02-03 - US-006
- **What was implemented**: Transaction status push notification formatting and service worker routing
- **Files changed**:
  - `src/lib/notifications.ts` (updated - transaction notification title/body formatting per AC)
  - `public/sw-push.js` (updated - explicit transaction type routing to listing detail)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Transaction notification format: title should contain actionable info (sender + action), body provides context
  - Service worker should explicitly list transaction types for clearer routing logic
  - All transaction notifications in useTransactions.ts already include listing_id in data for deep linking
  - The `new_inquiry` notification type exists but may not have a UI trigger yet - the formatting is ready
---

## 2026-02-03 - US-007
- **What was implemented**: Added warranty_expiring notification type and warranty reminder user settings
- **Files changed**:
  - `supabase/migrations/20260203000006_add_warranty_expiring_notification_type.sql` (new)
  - `src/types/database.ts` (updated - added warranty_expiring type and warranty_reminder_* settings)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When adding new notification types, must update both the SQL constraint and the TypeScript NotificationType union
  - User settings columns with defaults should use NOT NULL DEFAULT to ensure new users get sensible values
  - Database type definitions in database.ts have three places to update: interface, Insert type (with optional fields), and Row type
---

## 2026-02-03 - US-008
- **What was implemented**: Updated generate-reminders Edge Function for warranty alerts
- **Files changed**:
  - `supabase/migrations/20260203000007_add_warranty_expiry_date_to_items.sql` (new)
  - `supabase/functions/generate-reminders/index.ts` (updated - added warranty reminder logic)
  - `src/types/database.ts` (updated - added warranty_expiry_date to Item interface and Insert type)
  - `src/pages/ItemDetailPage.tsx` (updated - added warranty_expiry_date to RawItemDetails and transform)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When adding columns to items table, must update: migration, database.ts Item interface, database.ts Insert type, and any component-specific raw types
  - ItemDetailPage has its own RawItemDetails interface that mirrors Item - must be kept in sync manually
  - The generate-reminders function queries user_settings with `or('reminder_enabled.eq.true,warranty_reminder_enabled.eq.true')` to get users who want any type of reminder
  - Warranty notifications use 7-day deduplication window (longer than expiring_item's 24-hour window) to prevent spam for same item
  - formatDate helper function formats dates as "Month Day, Year" (e.g., "February 15, 2026") for user-friendly display

## 2026-02-03 - US-009
- **What was implemented**: Custom reminder push notifications
- **Files changed**:
  - `src/pages/ItemDetailPage.tsx` (updated - added reminder fields to RawItemDetails, transformRawItem, and Supabase query)
  - `src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx` (updated - removed unused icon components)
  - `src/pages/InventoryPage.tsx` (updated - fixed unused variable)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Custom reminder functionality was already implemented in generate-reminders Edge Function and migration 20260203000008
  - The ItemDetailPage has its own RawItemDetails interface that needs to be kept in sync with the Item type from database.ts
  - When adding new fields to items table, update: migration, database.ts Item interface, and ItemDetailPage RawItemDetails + query
  - Service worker (sw-push.js) already handles custom_reminder in itemReminderTypes array, routing to /item/{itemId}
  - Pre-existing unused code issues (noUnusedLocals) should be cleaned up when encountered to prevent build failures
---

## 2026-02-03 - US-010
- **What was implemented**: Tabbed navigation for NotificationsPage with Messages and Reminders tabs
- **Files changed**:
  - `src/pages/NotificationsPage.tsx` (updated - added tab bar, filtering, URL persistence, unread badges)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `useSearchParams` from react-router-dom for URL parameter persistence with `replace: true` to avoid history bloat
  - Use `useMemo` for efficient filtering and counting that depends on notifications array
  - MESSAGE_TYPES and REMINDER_TYPES constants centralize the notification type categorization
  - Tab default logic: check unread counts before URL param to provide smart defaults
  - Empty state should be tab-aware to provide contextually relevant messaging
  - Icon colors follow a consistent pattern: purple for warranty, teal for custom reminders
